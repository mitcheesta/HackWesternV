# HackWesternV

Personal branch for my team's hack for Hack Western 5.

Eventually moved files over to stdlib for hosting. Used IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer API with user inputted text. 

Based on result, site would output different text, images, and location-based recommendations (integrated Google Maps API). Node.js with Express for backend. PugJS and plain CSS for front-end.
